function [train_indices, test_indices] = k_fold_indices(num_images, num_folds)
% k_fold_indices takes in the number of images/datapoints and number of
% folds as input. It returns the train and test indices for each of the
% folds. Utilizing a cell array to save all train and test indices.

    % Generate random indicies equal to number of images ranging from 1 to
    % num_images, use to randomize test and train_indices
    r = randperm(num_images, num_images);    

    %Initialize x_idx array
    x_idx = {1:num_images}

    % 10% as test dataset
    % Define step size for test_indices array as being equal to num_folds
    test_indices_step_size = num_folds;

    % Define start point for indexing
    start_point = 1;
    
    % Create n folds
    for idx = 1:num_folds
        
        test_indices{idx} = r(x_idx{start_point : test_indices_step_size : end})
